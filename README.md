Ever wondered how an ATM really works? As a first project of my internship, I have assigned with a task to build one in Python! This isn't just a simple exercise; it's a dive into the core logic of an Automated Teller Machine. You'll find all the essential functions here secure login with User ID and PIN, checking your balance, depositing and withdrawing funds (with balance checks, of course!), and a safe exit. Think of it as your personal sandbox for exploring the fundamentals of financial transactions through code. Ready to see how it all comes together?

How It Works:
1. Authentication: Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to enter your User ID and PIN.
2. Main Menu: After successful authentication, a menu will display the available options:
      *Check Balance
      *Deposit Funds
      *Withdraw Cash
      *View Transaction History (If implemented)
      *Exit.
3. Action Selection: Choose an option from the menu to perform the desired transaction.
4. Input Validation: The program rigorously validates all user inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
5. Transaction Confirmation: Receive clear confirmation messages for each transaction, along with updated account balances.

Future Enhancements:
â€¢ Implement the Transaction History feature to provide a comprehensive record of account activity.Add error handling for invalid input and edge cases.Introduce a database integration for persistent data storage.Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
